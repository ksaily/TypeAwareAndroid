    <string name="con_intro">Welcome to Alertness Monitor! This app is part of a scientific study, which focuses on tracking users\' keyboard usage during the day. During the first week, the app will send you a notification every day to complete a brief questionnaire about how you have experienced your own keyboard usage. The second week you will also be shown an overview of the data that the app has collected and you will also be asked to answer the same daily questionnaire. If you do not receive a notification within 24hours after installation, please let us know.</string>

    <string name="con_data">"By pressing accept, you allow Alertness Monitor to anonymously collect app and keyboard usage data. All data will be securely stored on a server in compliance with European data protection laws (BGBl. I S. 2325). All the keyboard data will be encrypted before sending it to the server so nobody can see exactly what you have written. Logs will only be uploaded when you are connected to WiFi to prevent any upload cost. Your data will only be used in the context of our research and will never be shared with third parties. You can withdraw from the study at any moment by simply uninstalling the app. Thanks! And have fun with the tasks!</string>
